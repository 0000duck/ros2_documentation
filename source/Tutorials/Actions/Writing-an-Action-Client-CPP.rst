Writing an Action Client (C++)
==============================

Setting up the package
------------------

Before creating out C++ Action Client, we must first set up our package. First, navigate to the directory you created earlier
during the prerequisite:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change to the root of the workspace (ie. action_ws)
    cd ~/action_ws
    cd action_tutorials

Let's then create our new package for the C++ Action Client:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a ros2 package
    ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_cpp

We should first add the required dependencies to our ``package.xml``:

.. code-block:: xml

    <depend>action_tutorials_interfaces</depend>
    <depend>rclcpp</depend>
    <depend>rclcpp_action</depend>
    <depend>rclcpp_components</depend>

We then should set up our dependencies in out ``CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code-block:: cmake

    find_package(action_tutorials_interfaces REQUIRED)
    find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
    find_package(rclcpp_action REQUIRED)
    find_package(rclcpp_components REQUIRED)

Now that we have our dependencies setup, we can start writing our C++ action client

Title here
------------------

Navigate to the ``src`` directory and create a file ``fibonacci_action_client.cpp`` and add the following boilerplate code:

.. literalinclude:: client_0.c++
    :language: c++

Let's go over the code skeleton and make sure we're setup and ready for writing the client.

1. For the include statements, we first need to include ``action_tutorials_interfaces/action/fibonacci.hpp`` so that we can use the action we defined earlier.
2. We must import ``rclcpp_action.hpp`` and ``register_node_macro.hpp`` from ``rclcpp_action`` and ``rclcpp_components``. We need ``rclcpp_action`` so that we can both send an ``action_goal`` to our server and recieve feedback. We need ``rclcpp_components`` in order to make our node/class a component.
3. In our class, ``fibonacci_action_client``, which inherits from ``Node``, we have a constructor which has has one argument, taking ``NodeOptions``. 
4. The ``send_goal`` function sends the goal to the server and sets up callbacks for the initial response, the feedback throughout, and the final result from the server.
5. We have two private member variables, ``client_ptr_`` and ``timer_``. ``timer_`` is used to send the action goal to the server with a certain time interval. ``client_ptr_`` creates the action client and send the goal to the server.
6. Finally, we have our three callback functions â€“ one for intial response, one for feedback, and one for the final result.
7. On L50, we call a macro ``RCLCPP_COMPONENTS_REGISTER_NODE`` to register the plugin name, ``action_tutorials_cpp::FibonacciActionClient`` , with the ament resource index.

Now we will start writing out functions and get our client up and running

.. literalinclude:: client_1.c++
	:language: c++

In the constructor, we instantiate ``client_ptr_`` with FILL THIS OUT. We then instantiate ``timer_`` and bind it to the ``send_goal()`` function.

In ``send_goal()``, we first want to see if the server is available, and if not, shutdown the node. If the server is available, we want to prepare the action goal message and send it over the server. We then create our callbacks and add them to ``send_goal_options``, which is then sent to the sever along with the action goal message. After this, we can now fill out our callback functions.

.. literalinclude:: client_2.c++
	:language: c++

In ``goal_response_callback``, we want to get the respose from the server of whether it's accepted the goal or not. Once we get the response, we check if its  ``NULL`` to see whether its been accepted or not.

In ``feedback_callback``, we are waiting for the ``feedback`` message of the Fibonacci action. Every time we get feedback, it is the next number in the sequence, and we want to not only print out the next number, but also the entire sequence prior to it.

``result_callback`` is what returns to use the final result, once the server has sent back all the number in the Fibonacci sequence and completed the goal. However, since we are not sure if the server aborted or canceled the goal, we have to check for what type of result code we've gotten. If the goal was aborted or canceled, we simply log an error message and exit. If the goal is a success, we print out the entire fibonacci sequence. 

Now that we have written out fibonacci action client, we can now compile and run:

.. code-block:: bash
	cd ~/action_ws
	colcon build --packages-up-to action_tutorials_cpp

In another terminal:

..code-block:: bash
	source ~/action_ws/install/setup.bash
	ros2 run action_tutorials_cpp fibonacci_action_client
