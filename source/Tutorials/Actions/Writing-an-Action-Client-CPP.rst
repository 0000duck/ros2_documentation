Writing an Action Client (C++)
==============================

Coming soon.

Before creating out C++ Action Client, we must first set up our package. First, navigate to the directory you created earlier
during the prerequisite:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change to the root of the workspace (ie. action_ws)
    cd ~/action_ws
    cd action_tutorials

Let's then create our new package for the C++ Action Client:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a ros2 package
    ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_cpp
